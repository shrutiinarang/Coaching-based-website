# Coaching-based-website
I designed a really easy-to-use website for a coaching institute. It's got a smart chat assistant that helps users, and all the data is managed using Google Sheets in the background. The website looks good and works smoothly, thanks to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Whether you're a student, teacher, or admin, everything you need is in one place!
